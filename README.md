# Form Builder using React

Core Requirements / Tasks completed:

1) The builder can add and remove choices from the list of choices. Individual items are separated by a new line.

2) The Label field is required. Duplicates choices are not allowed. There cannot be more than 50 choices total.
If the default value is not one of the choices, it gets added to the list of choices when the field is saved.

3) Added a button that allows the builder to clear the form and start fresh.
The submit button creates json object and post it to http://www.mocky.io/v2/566061f21200008e3aabd919. It log the post data to the console.
